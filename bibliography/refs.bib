	abstract     = {Reactive mass transport (RMT) simulation is a powerful numerical tool to advance our understanding of complex geochemical processes and their feedbacks in relevant subsurface systems. Thermodynamic equilibrium defines the baseline for solubility, chemical kinetics, and RMT in general. Efficient RMT simulations can be based on the operator-splitting approach, where the solver of chemical equilibria is called by the mass transport part for each control volume whose composition, temperature, or pressure has changed. Modeling of complex natural systems requires consideration of multiphase--multicomponent geochemical models that include nonideal solutions (aqueous electrolytes, fluids, gases, solid solutions, and melts). Direct Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) methods have numerous advantages for the realistic geochemical modeling of such fluid--rock systems. Substantial improvements and extensions to the revised GEM interior point method algorithm based on Karpov's convex programming approach are described, as implemented in the GEMS3K C/C+{\thinspace}+ code, which is also the numerical kernel of GEM-Selektor v.3 package (http://gems.web.psi.ch). GEMS3K is presented in the context of the essential criteria of chemical plausibility, robustness of results, mass balance accuracy, numerical stability, speed, and portability to high-performance computing systems. The stand-alone GEMS3K code can treat very complex chemical systems with many nonideal solution phases accurately. It is fast, delivering chemically plausible and accurate results with the same or better mass balance precision as that of conventional speciation codes. GEMS3K is already used in several coupled RMT codes (e.g., OpenGeoSys-GEMS) capable of high-performance computing.}

This involves consideration of non-ideal multicomponent-multiphase systems that include dilute to concentrated aqueous electrolyte solutions, mineral solid solutions, supercritical fluids, silicate and metal melts, and sorption and ion exchange phases. Predicting the stability and thermodynamic properties of non-ideal solution phases over wide ranges of pressures and temperatures requires that theoretically sound and sufficiently accurate equation of state and activity models are used within the GEM framework. The variety of such models calls for a novel, flexible, and computationally efficient code architecture that supports a wide range of models of non-ideal mixing with different mathematical structures and input data. Here, we introduce the TSolMod C++ class library for equation of state and activity models, implemented within the GEMS3K solver of geochemical equilibria as part of the GEM-Selektor code package (http://gems.web.psi.ch). Essential features of the TSolMod library include a generic and flexible model parameter setup, computationally efficient data exchange with the GEM algorithm, and a straightforward extensibility with any new models of mixing. The current version of TSolMod features a comprehensive selection of fluid, gas, liquid, and solid solution models of interest for geochemical, petrological, material science, and chemical engineering applications.}}

	abstract 	= {GEMSFITS is a new code package for fitting internally consistent input parameters of GEM (Gibbs Energy Minimization) geochemical–thermodynamic models against various types of experimental or geochemical data, and for performing inverse modeling tasks. It consists of the gemsfit2 (parameter optimizer) and gfshell2 (graphical user interface) programs both accessing a NoSQL database, all developed with flexibility, generality, efficiency, and user friendliness in mind. The parameter optimizer gemsfit2 includes the GEMS3K chemical speciation solver (http://gems.web.psi.ch/GEMS3K), which features a comprehensive suite of non-ideal activity- and equation-of-state models of solution phases (aqueous electrolyte, gas and fluid mixtures, solid solutions, (ad)sorption. The gemsfit2 code uses the robust open-source NLopt library for parameter fitting, which provides a selection between several nonlinear optimization algorithms (global, local, gradient-based), and supports large-scale parallelization. The gemsfit2 code can also perform comprehensive statistical analysis of the fitted parameters (basic statistics, sensitivity, Monte Carlo confidence intervals), thus supporting the user with powerful tools for evaluating the quality of the fits and the physical significance of the model parameters. The gfshell2 code provides menu-driven setup of optimization options (data selection, properties to fit and their constraints, measured properties to compare with computed counterparts, and statistics). The practical utility, efficiency, and geochemical relevance of GEMSFITS is demonstrated by examples of typical classes of problems that include fitting of parameters of thermodynamic mixing models, optimization of standard state Gibbs energies of aqueous species and solid-solution end-members, thermobarometry, inverse titrations, and optimization problems that combine several parameter- and property types.}

Combined with correlations among parameters in the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equation of state (Shock et al., 1992), these estimates permit predictions of standard partial molal volumes (V°), heat capacities (C°P), and entropies (S°), as well as apparent standard partial molal enthalpies (ΔH°P,T) and Gibbs free energies (ΔḠ°P,T) of formation to 1000°C and 5 kb for hundreds of inorganic aqueous species of interest in geochemistry. Data and parameters for more than 300 inorganic aqueous species are presented. Close agreement between calculated and experimentally determined equilibrium constants for acid dissociation reactions and cation hydrolysis reactions supports the generality and validity of these predictive methods. These data facilitate the calculation of the speciation of major, minor, and trace elements in hydrothermal and metamorphic fluids throughout most of the crust of the Earth.}

The SUPCRT92 program reads or permits user-generation of its two input files, CON and RXN, retrieves data from the direct-access equivalent of SPRONS92.DAT, calculates the standard molal Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity, and volume of each reaction specified on the RXN file through a range of conditions specified on the CON file, and writes the calculated reaction properties to the output TAB file and, optionally, to PLT files that facilitate their graphical depiction. Calculations can be performed along the liquid side of the H2O vaporization boundary by specifying either temperature (T) or pressure (P), and in the single-phase regions of fluid H2O by specifying either T and P, T and H2O density, T and log K, or P and log K. SPRONS92.DAT, which contains standard molal thermodynamic properties at 25°C and 1 bar, equation-of-state parameters, heat capacity coefficients, and phase transition data for approximately 500 minerals, gases, and aqueous species, can be augmented or otherwise modified using MPRONS92, and converted to its direct-access equivalent using CPRONS92.}

We present a new coupling of the Richards flow module of the Finite Element (FE) based OpenGeoSys code with the GEM based chemical solver GEMS3K. The coupled code is highly parallelized using an overlapping domain decomposition approach in combination with execution of multiple threads that solve chemical equilibria in parallel. FE reactive transport schemes are often affected by spurious concentration oscillations. We effectively suppress these oscillations with a linearized algebraic flux corrected transport (FCT) algorithm. An application example is presented which investigates the evolution of material interfaces in a deep geological repository for nuclear waste. The example uses all features of the new coupled code: flow and multi-component transport in variably saturated media, and a very complex chemical setup which makes extensive use of (non-linear) solid solution formulations for mineral phases.}

	abstract = {Advanced reactive transport simulations of hydrothermal systems require the modelling of diverse physico-chemical phenomena, many of which have only partially been addressed in previous studies. Utilizing newly implemented capabilities of the CSMP++GEM code, we show the relevance of three phenomena: (1) At the example of alkali feldspars, we investigate how employing non-ideal solid solution models instead of pure mineral phases has a significant impact on the resulting chemical evolution of the system. For example, pH when considering solid solution differs by about 0.5 compared to a simulation with pure feldspar phases. Differences in aqueous K/Na ratios may be relevant for interpretation of the K/Na geothermometer and may, in addition, be biased by discrepancies in published thermodynamic databases as observed in this study. (2) Reactive transport at supercritical conditions (within the limits imposed by the HKF thermodynamic model) is illustrated by how a magmatic-hydrothermal fluid, equilibrated with granitic rock at 600 °C and 200 MPa, is reacted along a diffusion path with a similar rock at 400 °C and 50 MPa. This simple conceptual representation of hydrothermal alteration at the Butte porphyry copper deposit in Montana results in a reactive transport model that closely mimics the observed alteration zonation. (3) Emergent behaviour is observed for a simulation of two-phase vapour + liquid flow with partitioning of chemical species between the two phases. In this example, hot vapour front condenses into and displaces liquid, with a two-phase boiling/condensation zone developing in between. At the boundaries between steam and boiling zone, and between boiling zone and liquid zone, the interplay of partitioning of volatile species and different transport properties in the single- and two-phase regions leads to distinct local and transient effects: volatile species such as CO2, H2S and HCl may accumulate or deplete at strongly varying rates, affecting pH, redox state and activity of sulfide. The correct simulation of these effects will be relevant in understanding hydrothermal processes such as ore formation, mineral alteration, and the evolution of high enthalpy geothermal areas.}

	abstract = {The numerical simulation of reactive mass transport processes in complex geochemical environments is an important tool for the performance assessment of future waste repositories. A new combination of the multi-component mass transport code GeoSys/RockFlow and the Gibbs Energy Minimization (GEM) equilibrium solver GEM-Selektor is used to calculate the accurate equilibrium of multiple non-ideal solid solutions which are important for the immobilization of radionuclides such as Ra. The coupled code is verified by a widely used benchmark of dissolution–precipitation in a calcite–dolomite system. A more complex application shown in this paper is the transport of Ra in the near-field of a nuclear waste repository. Depending on the initial inventories of Sr, Ba and sulfate, non-ideal sulfate and carbonate solid solutions can fix mobile Ra cations. Due to the complex geochemical interactions, the reactive transport simulations can describe the migration of Ra in a much more realistic way than using the traditional linear KD approach only.}
