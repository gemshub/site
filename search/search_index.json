In  this version of GEM-Selektor, a mismatch in representation of output activities and activity coefficients has been fixed. This mismatch is potentially important for calculation of equilibria involving concentrated aqueous solutions. A test project (suggested by B.Lothenbach) is provided here; using this project with this and any older version of GEM-Selektor for comparisons, you will be able to see the magnitude of bias corrected by the present bugfix. In old projects where the ionic strength is less than 0.5 m, the bias is usually small and hardly visible on the Process or GtDemo plots. The detailed description of the mismatch and how it has been corrected is provided in the (updated) file Activity-Coeffs.pdf.</p> <p>19 May 2008</p> <p>BUGFIX RELEASE of GEMS-PSI  version 2.2.3 rc6 is now available for download for Win32 XP; Linux 32/64 rpm, and Intel Mac OS X 10.5 platforms. In  this version of GEM-Selektor, a few small annoying bugs were fixed, and some documentation extensions made (in particular, for using Pronsprep algorithms in ReacDC module).  More example Process scripts (written by Th.Wagner) for sequential reactors mode were added as well.</p> <p>This version of GEMS-PSI, for the first time, is provided as a .deb package for the Kubuntu 8 \"Hardy Heron\" 32-bit linux with KDE-3. We hope that this development will further expand the GEM-Selektor user community to Southern Hemisphere.</p> <p>31 March 2008</p> <p>INTERIM RELEASE of GEMS-PSI  version 2.2.3 rc5 is now available for download for Win32 XP; Linux 32/64 rpm, as well as for Intel Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5 platforms. In  this version of GEM-Selektor, the \"Smart Initial Approximation\" (SIA) mode has been further improved and tested. There were also numerous changes in the GEMIPM2 kernel code aimed at better reproducibility of results in automatic initial aproximation. Three methods of temperature/pressure extrapolation for aqueous complexes and non-polar dissolved species were built-in (contributed by Dr. Th. Wagner, ETHZ), documentation pending.</p> <p>13 February 2008</p> <p>INTERIM RELEASE of GEMS-PSI  version 2.2.2 rc4 is now available for download for Win32; Linux 32/64 rpm platforms; installers for Apple G4/G5 and Apple  Intel PCs are coming soon. This is the first released version of GEM-Selektor where a \"Smart Initial Approximation\" (SIA) mode can be used e.g. in Process Simulators. Depending on the system size, this accelerates calculations 5 times and more compared with version 2.2.1, or 10 to 60 times compared with versions 2.2.0 rc0 or earlier. The optional SIA mode needs an interim period of extensive testing.</p> <p>07 January 2008</p> <p>MAINTENANCE RELEASE of GEMS-PSI  version 2.2.1 rc3 is now available for download for Win32; Linux 32/64 rpm platforms, as well as (after 2 years break) for Apple G4/G5 PCs. We also provide for the first time the installation bundle for Apple Intel PCs (for now, Mac OS X 10.4 only).

This version uses the performance-optimized GEM IPM-2 numerical engine which runs 2 to 30 times faster than that in previous versions. It also incorporates important bugfixes, some of which result in improved quality and precision of calculated phase assemblage and speciation. We highly recommend upgrading to the latest GEMS version!</p> <p>03 August 2007</p> <p>COMING SOON! New release of GEM-Selektor code - version  2.2.0 release candidate - will be available for download for Win32 and Linux rpm platforms. This version uses the performance-optimized GEM IPM-2 numerical engine which runs 2 to 30 times faster than that in previous versions.  From version 2.2.1 on, the GEM solver will also be available as a standalone batch program GEMIPM2K which can be coupled with an existing or a new fluid-mass-transport, reaction path, or sensitivity analysis code, including those running on high-performance computers and clusters.  A major extension in version 2.2.0 is related to built-in implementations of models of non-ideal mixing in multi-component solid, liquid solutions and fluids (see List of Changes). Numerous bugfixes (see List of Corrections) result in unmatched stablilty of the program and in a better convergence than it was possible before. </p> <p>31 August 2006</p> <p>New release of GEM-Selektor code - version 2.1.2 (release candidate 3) - is now available for download (for Win32 and Linux 32/64 platforms).

In  this version of GEM-Selektor, a number of mixing models for condensed phases was added, in particular, Pitzer (HMW) model for aqueous activity coefficients. Treatment of metastability constraints for reproducing mineral dissolution/precipitation kinetics has been improved. Error diagnostics in the GEM IPM kernel has been made more thorough and strict to provide more information. Smart initial approximation mode was implemented to accelerate calculations.</p>"},{"location":"news/2020/12/07/2015-to-2020/","title":"2015 to 2020","text":"<p>07 December 2020</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.8.0 (rev. 50e150b5.2888e2a) code package is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. This release contains important bugfixes, including one in the GEM2MT calculations and another in the implementation of automatic compression of interaction parameters table in sublattice (multi-site) Berman and CEF solid solution models upon removal of some end members. The plot in the GraphDialog can now be copied on right-mouse click as image to clipboard or saved into an image file. The look and feel on high-resolution monitors up to 4k was improved, especially in Windows. Attention!  Starting from v.3.8.0, we distribute online installers for Windows and MacOS that are built in Qt Installer Framework. These installers automatically download and install GEM-Selektor and optionally GEMS3K and (coming soon) GEMSFITS codes. In Windows10, the code packages by default install into the user folder (C:\\Users\\\\GEMS3) in order to avoid problems for non-admin users; the user's modelling projects are now located in the user folder (C:\\Users\\\\Library\\Gems3\\projects) as well. In MacOS, default locations of the program (/Users//GEMS3/Gems3.app) and the users projects (/Users//GEMS3/Library/Gems3/projects/) are now similar to those in Windows10. This location is safe to persist even after the GEMS codes will be upgraded or completely removed using C:\\Users\\\\GEMS3\\MaintenanceTool.exe (in MacOS: /Users//GEMS3/maintenancetool.app). We highly recommend to upgrade your GEM-Selektor installation to this version (previous installations will not be affected). <p>25 March 2020</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.7.0 (rev. 50e150b5.2888e2a) code package is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. This release contains a significant improvement of GEMS3K numerical stability and faster convergence (the Pa_DK tolerance needs to be set 0.5 to 1 orders higher than before, e.g. to 1e-5 instead of 1e-6). Another improvement is the implementation of automatic compression of interaction parameters table in sublattice (multi-site) Berman and CEF solid solution models upon removal of some end members due to narrower list of Independent Components in modelling project or in the system. There were also improvements in documentation and wizard scripts for 'R' - type processes (SFTR- Single Flow-Through Reactor) mode. We highly recommend to upgrade your GEM-Selektor installation to this version.</p> <p>29 October 2019</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.6.0 (rev. b17fbf5.7940cbb) code package is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. Starting from this release, the source code of GEM-Selektor GUI part is distributed under the GPL v.3 license because of replacing the graphics dialog module with its implementation based on QtCharts. The GEMS3K numerical code part is distributed under the LGPL v.3 license, as before. This release also contains some relevant bugfixes in the GEM2MT module (random-walk algorithm) and in the calculation of CEF sublattice solid solution models. The default database now contains some thermodynamic data and phase definitions for the ClaySor sorption models for illite and montmorillonite, described in detail in NAB 18-027 (2019) report.</p> <p>19 May 2019</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.5.0 (rev. 80423ef.707e5ad) code package is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. This is a moderate improvement release, featuring simple reactive transport simulation tools (GEM2MT module, Process simulations in R mode) in a revised, much better documented and ready to use shape. Explore the respective wizards to create in minutes some stepwise flow-through reactor leaching or flushing simulations (Process R mode), then switch to GEM2MT module with a sequential reactor chain (S mode), box-flux chain (F mode) and generic box-flux scheme with internal sources/sinks (B mode), as well as 1-D advection-dispersion (A mode) or advection-diffusion (W mode) models. All these modes are well suited for studying water-rock (or water-cement) interactions at different levels of complexity. This release also contains bugfixes in GEMS3K and GEM-Selektor improving the runtime performance.</p> <p>07 January 2019</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.4.5 (rev. dcffc63.39b782e) code package is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page.

Many bugfixes done, improvements include ClaySor sorption model and Vinograd MBW solid solution model implementations.</p> <p>07 April 2017</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.3.5 (rev. ee754fe.a73e674) code package is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. This is a bugfix release built with the Qt  5.7 (runs on Windows7, 8, 10; on Mac OS X 10.11, 10.12; on (k)ubuntu linux 16.04). Bugfixes and improvements include more robust kinetics simulations and (fixed) 1-D reactive transport (advection-dispersion) simulations with finite-differences method.

Easier to get than ever before!</p> <p>09 December 2015</p> <p>MINES 2015 v.1 is a thermodynamics database prepared for modeling magmatic-hydrothermal ore forming processes by Prof. Alex Gysi (Colorado School of Mines, USA). It is now available for downloading from the MINES TDB web page. Please see also the GEMS Contributors page. A welcomed extension of our geography and coverage of modelling topics, applications and tutorials!</p> <p>13 April 2015</p> <p>The GEM-Selektor version 3.3.3 (rev. 2646.1036) code and database package now becomes available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. This is a next sub-version release built with the Qt version 5.4.1 (runs also on Mac OS X 10.9, 10.10). GEM-Selektor v.3.3.3 was in internal development for over two years; it contains important extensions of the Phase record format and data structure, as well as the Phase remake wizard, made in order to accommodate more flexible mixing models (TSolMod), built-in mineral-water reaction kinetics (TKinMet), and a new implementation of sorption and surface complexation models (TSorpMod; work still in progress). Some test projects were also improved or updated. In the DB.default database, all Phase records were converted into the new extended format, and the default PSI/Nagra thermodynamic database was updated to status 12/07 (see https://www.psi.ch/en/les/software-and-database).</p> <p>For backward compatibility, all modelling projects created in GEM-Selektor v.3.2.x or earlier, will open and work normally in GEM-Selektor v.3.3.x; accordingly, GEMS3K I/O files exported from GEM-Selektor v.3.2.x are readable and will work in coupled codes and examples using GEMS3K v.3.3.x. A prerequisite of this is that no Phase record is created or remade in such a project having the \"old\" record format.</p> <p>Immediate extension of old modeling projects in GEM-Selektor v.3.3.x with newly created Phase records, remaking existing Phase records, or via Project remake/extension wizard is possible. Before doing that, the user needs only once to open the project; switch to Database Mode; open the Phase window; and remake one-by-one all Phase records available in the project (saving each record back after remake). This will ensure that new or modified phases with extended structure and functionality will work correctly. Note that if some Phase records remain in the \"old\" format (i.e. not remade) then this will lead to errors or crashes during calculations of equilibria in systems from this project.</p> <p>It is essential that ALL Phase records go once through the Phase remake wizard! Even opening and closing a modeling project once in the GEM-Selektor v.3.3.x will render this project unusable in earlier versions of GEM-Selektor (3.2.x or less). For these reasons, if you have used GEM-Selektor v.3.2.x or earlier, we recommend not to upgrade it, but to install GEM-Selektor v.3.3.x to a new location in your PC, check it, and then copy your old modelling projects into the work project directory of the new version (usually like \\MyGEMS33\\Library\\Gems3\\projects).</p>"},{"location":"news/2021/12/23/changes-2021/","title":"Changes 2021","text":"<p>23 December 2021</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.9.3 (rev. 65db334.18b094c) code package, built using Qt6.2 LTS, is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. This is a bugfix release, also adding more functionality to GEM2MT simulations: now the modification of nodes at a time step in the middle of the simulation works if this modification is coded in the control script. More memory leaks were removed; better handling of math exceptions also implemented. Initial configuration files of GEM-Selektor are now provided in JSON format for better compatibility. The graphics in runtime mode of Process simulations has been improved. Minor fixes are reflected in commit messages in the source code repository. An upgrade to this version of GEM-Selektor surely makes sense.</p> <p>05 November 2021</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.9.2 (rev. 96323c0.8986188) code package, built using Qt6.2 LTS, is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. This bugfix release has several important issues fixed. GEM2MT simulations of box-flux 'B' type dynamic reactive transport now run correctly, including mobile groups of solid/liquid phases, various types of first-order fluxes and sinks, etc. The  large definitions of SIT aqueous phase are now automatically compressed upon creation of a new modelling project including the list of interaction parameter comments, and re-compressed when cloning the project into an extended one. Some \"yes/no\" dialogs were extended into \"yes/no/yes-to-all/no-to-all\" style. The GtDemo wizard was re-arranged for early selection of records to sample in a way consistent with previously improved ReacDC and Phase wizards. The GEMS3K module was enhanced with much more extensive handling of math exceptions, warnings and error messages. GEMS3K can now read/write files in JSON and exchange data in memory as JSON strings. GEM-Selektor can export GEMS3K files in JSON format and backup/restore all types of database records in JSON files (this is more reliable than old customary text format for backup/restore). Numerous minor fixes and improvements are reflected in source code repository commit messages. In view of all this, an upgrade to this version of GEM-Selektor is highly recommended.</p> <p>17 June 2021</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.9.0 (rev. e7e92e0.8bcdafa) code package is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. This version contains many bugfixes and significant changes in the user interface. The comment lines for the SysEq record are now visible and editable completely in both Recipe Dialog and in the main system widget, to encourage users better document their work. The ReacDC wizard and Phase wizard underwent radical changes to become more logical: the selection of chemical species (dependent components) involved into a reaction or a phase occurs now at the beginning of the wizard configuration process, not after it, as before. This also allows to add better consistency checks among various dimensions and modes, which was not possible before (new checks will be added into the next release). In addition, this is the first release using the Qt6.1 framework - a major upgrade from the Qt5 framework maintained during almost 9 years. Help pages were also extended/corrected to a significant extent. The look and feel on high-resolution monitors up to 4k was improved, especially in Windows, even more. The installers, both off-line and on-line, are built using the Qt Installer Framework (QtIFW) version 4.
