In  this version of GEM-Selektor, a mismatch in representation of output activities and activity coefficients has been fixed. This mismatch is potentially important for calculation of equilibria involving concentrated aqueous solutions. A test project (suggested by B.Lothenbach) is provided here; using this project with this and any older version of GEM-Selektor for comparisons, you will be able to see the magnitude of bias corrected by the present bugfix. In old projects where the ionic strength is less than 0.5 m, the bias is usually small and hardly visible on the Process or GtDemo plots. The detailed description of the mismatch and how it has been corrected is provided in the (updated) file Activity-Coeffs.pdf.</p> <p>19 May 2008</p> <p>BUGFIX RELEASE of GEMS-PSI  version 2.2.3 rc6 is now available for download for Win32 XP; Linux 32/64 rpm, and Intel Mac OS X 10.5 platforms.

This release contains important bugfixes, including one in the GEM2MT calculations and another in the implementation of automatic compression of interaction parameters table in sublattice (multi-site) Berman and CEF solid solution models upon removal of some end members. The plot in the GraphDialog can now be copied on right-mouse click as image to clipboard or saved into an image file. The look and feel on high-resolution monitors up to 4k was improved, especially in Windows. Attention!  Starting from v.3.8.0, we distribute online installers for Windows and MacOS that are built in Qt Installer Framework. These installers automatically download and install GEM-Selektor and optionally GEMS3K and (coming soon) GEMSFITS codes. In Windows10, the code packages by default install into the user folder (C:\\Users\\\\GEMS3) in order to avoid problems for non-admin users; the user's modelling projects are now located in the user folder (C:\\Users\\\\Library\\Gems3\\projects) as well. In MacOS, default locations of the program (/Users//GEMS3/Gems3.app) and the users projects (/Users//GEMS3/Library/Gems3/projects/) are now similar to those in Windows10. This location is safe to persist even after the GEMS codes will be upgraded or completely removed using C:\\Users\\\\GEMS3\\MaintenanceTool.exe (in MacOS: /Users//GEMS3/maintenancetool.app).

This is a bugfix release built with the Qt  5.7 (runs on Windows 7, 8, 10; on Mac OS X 10.11; on (k)ubuntu linux 16.04). Bugfixes and improvements include memory leaks; refreshed Flowline test project; and corrected output of thermodynamic properties of liquid water and water vapor around saturated water vapor curve at Psat in systems where both aqueous phase and gas phase are present.

It is now available for downloading from the MINES TDB web page. Please see also the GEMS Contributors page. A welcomed extension of our geography and coverage of modelling topics, applications and tutorials!</p> <p>13 April 2015</p> <p>The GEM-Selektor version 3.3.3 (rev. 2646.1036) code and database package now becomes available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. This is a next sub-version release built with the Qt version 5.4.1 (runs also on Mac OS X 10.9, 10.10). GEM-Selektor v.3.3.3 was in internal development for over two years; it contains important extensions of the Phase record format and data structure, as well as the Phase remake wizard, made in order to accommodate more flexible mixing models (TSolMod), built-in mineral-water reaction kinetics (TKinMet), and a new implementation of sorption and surface complexation models (TSorpMod; work still in progress). Some test projects were also improved or updated. In the DB.default database, all Phase records were converted into the new extended format, and the default PSI/Nagra thermodynamic database was updated to status 12/07 (see https://www.psi.ch/en/les/software-and-database).</p> <p>For backward compatibility, all modelling projects created in GEM-Selektor v.3.2.x or earlier, will open and work normally in GEM-Selektor v.3.3.x; accordingly, GEMS3K I/O files exported from GEM-Selektor v.3.2.x are readable and will work in coupled codes and examples using GEMS3K v.3.3.x. A prerequisite of this is that no Phase record is created or remade in such a project having the \"old\" record format.</p> <p>Immediate extension of old modeling projects in GEM-Selektor v.3.3.x with newly created Phase records, remaking existing Phase records, or via Project remake/extension wizard is possible. Before doing that, the user needs only once to open the project; switch to Database Mode; open the Phase window; and remake one-by-one all Phase records available in the project (saving each record back after remake). This will ensure that new or modified phases with extended structure and functionality will work correctly. Note that if some Phase records remain in the \"old\" format (i.e. not remade) then this will lead to errors or crashes during calculations of equilibria in systems from this project.</p> <p>It is essential that ALL Phase records go once through the Phase remake wizard! Even opening and closing a modeling project once in the GEM-Selektor v.3.3.x will render this project unusable in earlier versions of GEM-Selektor (3.2.x or less). For these reasons, if you have used GEM-Selektor v.3.2.x or earlier, we recommend not to upgrade it, but to install GEM-Selektor v.3.3.x to a new location in your PC, check it, and then copy your old modelling projects into the work project directory of the new version (usually like \\MyGEMS33\\Library\\Gems3\\projects).</p>"},{"location":"news/2021/12/23/changes-2021/","title":"Changes 2021","text":"<p>23 December 2021</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.9.3 (rev. 65db334.18b094c) code package, built using Qt6.2 LTS, is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. This is a bugfix release, also adding more functionality to GEM2MT simulations: now the modification of nodes at a time step in the middle of the simulation works if this modification is coded in the control script. More memory leaks were removed; better handling of math exceptions also implemented. Initial configuration files of GEM-Selektor are now provided in JSON format for better compatibility. The graphics in runtime mode of Process simulations has been improved. Minor fixes are reflected in commit messages in the source code repository. An upgrade to this version of GEM-Selektor surely makes sense.</p> <p>05 November 2021</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.9.2 (rev. 96323c0.8986188) code package, built using Qt6.2 LTS, is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. This bugfix release has several important issues fixed. GEM2MT simulations of box-flux 'B' type dynamic reactive transport now run correctly, including mobile groups of solid/liquid phases, various types of first-order fluxes and sinks, etc. The  large definitions of SIT aqueous phase are now automatically compressed upon creation of a new modelling project including the list of interaction parameter comments, and re-compressed when cloning the project into an extended one. Some \"yes/no\" dialogs were extended into \"yes/no/yes-to-all/no-to-all\" style. The GtDemo wizard was re-arranged for early selection of records to sample in a way consistent with previously improved ReacDC and Phase wizards. The GEMS3K module was enhanced with much more extensive handling of math exceptions, warnings and error messages. GEMS3K can now read/write files in JSON and exchange data in memory as JSON strings. GEM-Selektor can export GEMS3K files in JSON format and backup/restore all types of database records in JSON files (this is more reliable than old customary text format for backup/restore). Numerous minor fixes and improvements are reflected in source code repository commit messages. In view of all this, an upgrade to this version of GEM-Selektor is highly recommended.</p> <p>17 June 2021</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.9.0 (rev. e7e92e0.8bcdafa) code package is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page. This version contains many bugfixes and significant changes in the user interface. The comment lines for the SysEq record are now visible and editable completely in both Recipe Dialog and in the main system widget, to encourage users better document their work. The ReacDC wizard and Phase wizard underwent radical changes to become more logical: the selection of chemical species (dependent components) involved into a reaction or a phase occurs now at the beginning of the wizard configuration process, not after it, as before. This also allows to add better consistency checks among various dimensions and modes, which was not possible before (new checks will be added into the next release). In addition, this is the first release using the Qt6.1 framework - a major upgrade from the Qt5 framework maintained during almost 9 years. Help pages were also extended/corrected to a significant extent. The look and feel on high-resolution monitors up to 4k was improved, especially in Windows, even more. The installers, both off-line and on-line, are built using the Qt Installer Framework (QtIFW) version 4. The upgrade to this version is highly recommended.</p>"},{"location":"news/2022/04/14/changes-2022/","title":"Changes 2022","text":"<p>20 June 2022\":</p> <p>GEM-Selektor version 3.9.5 (rev. 9f3dc56.6dae7a9) code package, built using Qt6.2 LTS, is now available for downloading from the GEM-Selektor web page.

As of June 26, 2023, a hot-fixed installer has replaced the previous version to resolve this issue.  </p> <ul> <li>Users who prefer not to reinstall can follow the workaround detailed in section 1.1A of the Installation Instructions (PDF).  </li> </ul> <p>This issue also affected macOS and Linux variants, and hot-fixed installers are now available for all platforms.  </p> <p>Windows Unknown Program</p> <p>Because the installer package is not officially registered with Microsoft, a warning popup will appear when starting the installer: <code>Windows Protected Your PC</code>. To proceed with the installation, click More Info, then select Run Anyway.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Windows Security Warnings</p> <p>When launching the installer on Windows 10/11, you may encounter warnings from Windows Defender due to Microsoft\u2019s increasing security restrictions.  </p> <p>This is normal and does not indicate a virus. However, due to limited manpower, the GEMS development team cannot always meet Microsoft\u2019s strict certification requirements. We appreciate your trust and patience.  </p> <p>GEMS Fails to Start on Windows</p> <p>On some older or outdated versions of Windows, GEMS may fail to start due to missing dependencies.
