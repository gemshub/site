---
 A new version of GEM-Selektor is released, v3.10.0. [:octicons-arrow-right-24: download](site/../../start/gemselektor/download) 
 
 This version comes with a different way of installing GEM-Selektor. Just by downloading the program archive an unzipping it in the user (or any other) folder. This makes GEMS more portable. Changes include improved tooltips with phases and species names and formulas, improved default numerical settings especially when modeling systems with solid solutions.
