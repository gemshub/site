**Standalone Solver of Chemical Equilibria for Coupled Simulation Codes**

 Codes can be coupled to GEM-Standalone through its [C/C++](#gems3k-interfaces) and [Python](#modern-xgems-c-and-python-interface) interfaces. GEMS3K Standalone is a powerful and flexible tool for geochemical modeling, enabling high-precision equilibrium calculations in diverse applications.

- [x] Equilibrium solver capable of modeling complex (geo)chemical systems with many non-ideal solutions.
- [x] Supports variable temperature and pressure with substantial improvements in Gibbs Energy Minimization algorithms.
- [x] Fast, accurate, and ensures excellent mass balance precision.
- [x] Written in C/C++, open-source, and fully parallelizable on HPC architectures.
- [x] Python interface available via `xGEMS` (installable from `conda-forge`).
- [x] Serves as the numerical kernel of the GEM-Selektor geochemical modeling package.
- [x] GEM-Selektor can export input files for GEMS3K with a simple mouse click.
- [x] Used in developing coupled reactive mass transport simulation codes, such as OpenGeoSys-GEM.
- [x] Integrated into parameter fitting frameworks like [GEMSFITS](../gemsfits).


GEMS3K (formerly GEMIPM2K) is a standalone C/C++ code implementing the efficient numerical kernel [IPM-3](#gems-standalone-gems3k "more information in doc/html/theory_gem.html help file") of the GEM-Selektor v.3 package. It enables geochemical thermodynamic modeling of local/partial equilibria in complex heterogeneous multicomponent-multiphase systems. The code includes the TSolMod library, which provides built-in phase models of non-ideal mixing for a broad range of geochemical applications ([more...](solutionmodels)). GEMS3K employs fast and efficient linear algebra solvers from the [JAMA C++ TNT package](http://math.nist.gov/tnt/download.html) (NIST).

GEMS3K is released under the [Lesser GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html) v.3 license, promoting broad applications in hydro(thermal)- and waste geochemistry research. The code is provided for implementation of various reactive-mass-transport and other coupled codes, where massive, chemically plausible computations of local/partial equilibrium states are necessary, including HPC codes.  

GEMS3K runs under Windows, Mac OSX and Linux desktop PCs, as well as on various parallel architectures. 

## GEMS3K Interfaces

### C++ Interface

GEMS3K provides a flexible `TNode` C/C++ interface for data exchange in coupled simulations.

### Modern xGEMS C++ and Python Interface

The [`xGEMS`](download#xgems) is a modern interface (`ChemicalEngine`) accessible from C/C++ amd Python. Python module enables seamless integration of GEMS3K into Python workflows, allowing researchers to leverage its capabilities in data analysis and machine learning applications.

## Examples of Coupled Codes

GEMS3K can be integrated into high-performance computing (HPC) frameworks, enabling coupling with reactive mass transport codes such as:

Input files (text format) for GEMS3K can be exported from GEM-Selektor or manually prepared using any text editor. Runtime data exchange within coupled codes can be implemented in computer memory via the `TNode` class functions.
