To start working with GEM-Selektor and perform exciting geochemical calculations, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the graphical user interface. Frequent tasks include:

1. **Creating a Modeling Project:**
    - Open GEM-Selektor and click on "New Project" in the Modeling Projects window.
    - Name your project and select the appropriate thermodynamic database.
    - Choose your system components, relevant elements, to automatically include relevant phases in your project.

2. **Performing Process Calculations:**
    - Use the built-in tools to simulate various geochemical processes, such as dissolution, precipitation, sorption, fluid-rock interactions, cooling, fluid mixing, and leaching.
    - You can model reaction paths, titrations, and other mass-transfer processes by setting up the system's bulk composition and constraints.

3. **Making Changes to Thermodynamic Data:**
    - Modify the [thermodynamic database](../databases) by adding or removing species and phases relevant to your specific project.
    - Ensure that the changes are reflected in your project's calculations by updating the database files in the appropriate folder.


## Important folders 

When working with GEM-Selektor two folder locations are important: 

(**1**) **GEMS Program folder** containing the executable code, the default database files, and resources. Here you find the `DB.default` folder where you need to copy any third-party databases you plan to use to create new modeling projects.

(**2**) **GEMS Projects folder** containing test projects that come with the installation and all user projects. You can exchange projects with others by sending or receiving projects folders.

## Help contents

<div class="grid" markdown>

The most direct way to get information about anything in GEMS is to use its content-aware help interface. This can be accessed from anywhere in the code by pressing F1 (on Mac using the keyboard shortcut Command (âŒ˜) + Shift + ?) or the "Help" button <img src="help_.png">. This will open the **help window with context-specific information about the current window**.

## Test projects 

<div class="grid" markdown>

![Selektor Test Projects](selektor_test_projects.png " <b> GEMS Test projects:</b>see the New/Open projects list window"){ width="600" align=left } 

The GEM-Selektor comes with a **suite of test modeling projects**. These are included in the GEMS3 installer (see `Gems3-app/Resources/projects/`) and will be automatically copied to the user projects directory (e.g., `/Library/Gems3/projects/`) upon the first installation. The test projects address specific problems and can help you **learn how they were defined, serving as a starting point for your own modeling applications**. Plan to model something similar, you can clone the project, re-name it, and adapt it to your specific system. Before diving too deep into these projects it is expected that you gained some basic knowledge on using GEMS.

## [Workshops and tutorials](../../../community)
Have a look at the schedule for future [workshops](../../../community/workshops) or the available online [recordings](../../../community/workshops#online-workshops-learning-material). There are several materials and tutorials available on how to use GEM-Selektor to model cementitious systems and fluid rock interaction at hydrothermal conditions.
