## Postdoctoral Fellow @PSI 

Your tasks

* Develop and refine thermodynamic models for fission products release from coolant (Lead-Bismuth alloy), relevant to the safety of Lead-cooled Fast Reactors, using the open-source thermodynamic modelling software (GEMS). Couple thermodynamics to transport codes 
* Characterize cementitious pore fluid chemistry using thermodynamic modelling in alkali-activated and ternary-blended binders to assess compatibility with various nuclear waste streams 
* Investigate cesium transport pathways and mechanisms from spent nuclear fuel, using GEMS coupling with 2D/3D pore-level lattice Boltzmann simulators. Apply machine learning based surrogate models to accelerate geochemical modelling 
* Publishing the results in peer reviewed research papers, and presentations to showcase the work conducted

Please submit your application online by **8 June 2025** (including list of publications and addresses of referees) for the position as a postdoctoral researcher. [:octicons-arrow-right-24: More Information and Application](https://www.psi.ch/en/hr/job-opportunities/70007-postdoctoral-fellow)
