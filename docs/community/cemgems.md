CemGEMS is a free-to-use web application designed to assist cement chemists, students, and industrial engineers in performing and visualizing thermodynamic simulations of cement hydration and degradation processes. CemGEMS utilizes the GEM-Standalone (xGEMS) code alongside the PSI/Nagra and Cemdata18 chemical thermodynamic databases to deliver accurate and reliable results. ​

The platform offers a selection of real-data cement recipe templates, enabling users to model various cement types and their interactions. Its user-friendly interface simplifies complex thermodynamic modeling, making it accessible for both educational and professional applications. ​
